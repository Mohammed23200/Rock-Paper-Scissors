# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## 🎯 Project Overview
A fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with Python as part of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This project demonstrates the implementation of basic game logic, user input handling, and ASCII art in Python.

## ✨ Features
- 🎲 Interactive command-line interface
- 🖼️ ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors
- 🎯 Random computer opponent
- 🏆 Win/Lose/Draw game logic
- 🎨 Emoji-rich user feedback
- ⚡ Real-time game results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Random module for computer choices
- ASCII art for visual representation

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the game using Python
2. Choose your move:
   - 0 for Rock 🪨
   - 1 for Paper 📄
   - 2 for Scissors ✂️
3. The computer will make its choice
4. See who wins! 🎉
